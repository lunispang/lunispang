# Hi, I’m lunispang

I’m interested in game dev and learning new things.

I’m currently learning rust for fun, and I have made 2 projects in it so far;

- [tic tac toe in rust](https://github.com/lunispang/tic-tac-toe-rust)
  
- [snake game in rust](https://github.com/lunispang/rusty-snake)

If you want to contact me for any reason, you can reach me at @lunispang on Discord.
